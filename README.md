#Adio

*Requires Vim 7.3 or greater*

Adio is a dark colorscheme for Vim. Is made only for terminals supporting 256 colors. Syntax highlight is based on Monokai.

To make the Vertical Split Character look like a line, make sure you add this to your .vimrc file:

	set encoding=utf-8
  set fillchars=vert:\â”‚


To enable the current line number highlighting, set the cursorline and number.

	set number
	set cursorline



The colorscheme goes great with [iTerm2 adio profile](http://link-goes-here.com) and [tmux adio theme](http://link-goes-here.com).
