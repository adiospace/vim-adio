# Adio

*Requires Vim 7.3 or greater*

Adio is a dark colorscheme made only for terminals suporting 256 colors. Syntax highlighting is based on Monokai colorscheme.

## Install

You can easily install it using a plugin manager like
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) or
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

For example, if you have Vundle installed, you just declare the bundle you wish
to install in your `.vimrc`

    Bundle 'adrianolaru/vim-adio'

and then open Vim and run `:BundleInstall` command.

## Configuration

To make the Vertical Split Character look like a line, make sure you add this to your `.vimrc` file:

    set encoding=utf-8
    set fillchars=vert:\â”‚


To enable the current line number highlighting, set the cursorline and number.

    set number
    set cursorline
