#Adio

*Requires Vim 7.3 or greater*

Adio is a dark colorscheme for Vim. Is made only for terminals supporting 256 colors. Syntax highlighting is based on Monokai colorscheme.

To make the Vertical Split Character look like a line, make sure you add this to your .vimrc file:

    set encoding=utf-8
    set fillchars=vert:\│


To enable the current line number highlighting, set the cursorline and number.

	set number
	set cursorline
